      5: 'Incorrect. Bradycardia with hypotension is late: the heart muscle itself is now short of oxygen and failing. It often comes just before arrest — far too late to count as early.'
    },
    phys: 'O₂ falls → the brain feels it first (restless, anxious, confused) → sympathetic surge speeds the heart → chemoreceptors speed breathing. When reserves run out → the heart slows, BP drops, and enough hemoglobin is unloaded that the skin turns blue.',

      1: 'Correct. The scope irritates the larynx and bronchi. Laryngospasm (stridor) or bronchospasm (wheezing) can narrow the airway in the first hours.',
      3: 'Correct. Sedatives blunt the drive to breathe. Watch SpO₂, RR and how easily the client wakes until they are fully recovered.',
      5: 'Correct. Fever points to infection or aspiration. Sudden chest pain or dyspnea after a biopsy suggests the pleura was nicked — pneumothorax.'
    },
    phys: 'Lidocaine spray numbs the throat → no gag or cough → food or fluid can slip silently into the airway. Sedation → less drive to breathe. The biopsy forceps can tear small vessels (blood-streaked sputum) or, rarely, the pleura (pneumothorax).',

    },
    phys: 'Opioid → the brainstem stops responding to CO₂ → slower, shallower breaths → CO₂ builds → carbonic acid lowers the pH → CO₂ itself sedates → breathing slows further (a spiral). Supplemental oxygen keeps SpO₂ up, so the oximeter hides it.',

      2: 'Correct. A silent upper field means air in the pleural space. Air rises, so a pneumothorax is heard first at the top.',
      3: 'Reassuring for now. A midline trachea means no tension pneumothorax pushing the mediastinum yet. Keep checking, but this alone is not the report.',
      4: 'Correct. Draining a lot of fluid fast (usually no more than about 1,000–1,500 mL at once) lets the squeezed lung re-expand suddenly and leak fluid into the alveoli — re-expansion pulmonary edema.'

    phys: 'Needle nicks the lung → air enters the pleural space → that part of the lung collapses → absent sounds and hypoxemia. Large, fast fluid removal → the compressed lung springs open → its capillaries leak → pink frothy sputum.',
